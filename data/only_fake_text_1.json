Not much of an empowerment here. \u00a0Here, the\u00a0PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product,\u00a0including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from,\u00a0this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.\u00a0The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\"\u00a0This is what not shared on the JD.\u00a0\"How you will mature your career.\"\u00a0Job Responsibilities:\u00a0\u2022 For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.
